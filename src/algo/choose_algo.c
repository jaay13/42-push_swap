/*  After checking the task carefully I think using a tiny sort is not what the task
 	actually wants as it says: Any selector should work regardless of input size or disorder

	which means for me at least: 
	--complex should use a complex algorithm even if input is 2, 3, 4, 5 DONE
	same for the others DONE
	means no tiny_sort rerouting allowed?
	The user should obviously know it will perform worse, but should have the freedom to choose

	TODO:
	remove tiny_sort and refactor so its task compliant DONE
	add special cases in each algorithm to handle these low inputs possible? (TODO)
	
	EXTRA:
	with this option if using --complex and --bench bench would say used complex algorithm
	which would be misleading if input is under 5 numbersd DONE


	15/06:
	After talking to peers and considering again, incorporating a tiny_sort in choose_algo is wrong.
	This I had correct, but as I already though in "add special cases in each algorithm" from before:
	Is probably the correct way, reimplementing a helper like tiny sort and passing this into each function
	at the beginning as this wouldnt change the complexity of the strategy following, they all just use a
	base size helper and distinction between Big-O are quite irrelevant at this size anyways. Otherwise using
	no base size helper might in the end fail us because of thresholds that some peers mentioned.

	SO implement tiny_sort helper again in the algos (TODO)
